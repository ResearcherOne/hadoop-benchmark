# SWIM

Benchmark based on [SWIM](https://github.com/SWIMProjectUCB/SWIM).

In this example, we generated a simple concurrent workload which only consists of 50 Mapreduce jobs.
The workloads files are visible under `image/SWIM` directory.

Users can also generate new Mapreduce workloads by following SWIM tutorial, and only replace the workloads files under `image/SWIM` by those of new workloads.
