# Hadoop MapReduce Examples

Benchmark based on [hadoop-mapreduce-examples](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/tree/trunk/hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-examples).

Because all these benchmarks are packaged in hadoop, users only need to launch one docker container from `hadoop-benchmark/hadoop` image.
